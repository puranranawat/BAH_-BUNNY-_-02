# COIT20246 Networking and Cyber Security Project – Truelec

## 1. Project Overview
This project is about designing a secure and reliable computer network for Truelec. Truelec has one main office (Headquarters) and multiple branch offices. In this project, we created a network design for the Headquarters and one branch office. We also studied cloud server options for hosting Truelec’s booking application. Lastly, we completed a cyber security risk assessment, suggested security controls, discussed ethical issues, and reflected on our teamwork.
