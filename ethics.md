# Task 4.4 – Ethical and Social Issues

## 1. Overview
Ethics is important in networking and cyber security because companies collect and store personal data. Truelec must protect customer and staff data to maintain trust. If Truelec misuses data or fails to secure it, it can harm people and cause serious business problems.

## 2. Types of Data Collected by Truelec
Truelec collects different types of customer and staff data such as:
- Customer name, email, phone number
- Booking and reservation details
- Payment-related information
- CCTV footage inside and outside stores
- Staff personal details and account information

## 3. Ethical Issues

### 3.1 Privacy and Consent
Truelec uses CCTV cameras and collects customer data through the booking application. Ethically, Truelec must inform customers and staff about data collection. People should know what data is collected and why it is needed. Truelec should also avoid collecting unnecessary data.

### 3.2 Data Security and Breach Impact
If customer data is leaked, customers can face identity theft and financial fraud. Staff can also be harmed if personal data is exposed. This creates loss of trust and reputation damage for Truelec. It is Truelec’s ethical duty to protect data properly.

### 3.3 Data Retention and Access Control
Truelec should only store data for the time required. Old data should be deleted safely. Truelec should use least privilege access, meaning only authorized staff can access customer data and CCTV footage.

## 4. Social Impacts
A major cyber attack can affect customers and the public. Customers may stop using Truelec’s booking services. Staff may lose job security if the company suffers losses. Also, misuse of CCTV monitoring can cause stress and fear among employees.

## 5. Regulations / Standards
Truelec must follow relevant data protection rules such as:
- Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)
- Data breach notification requirements
If Truelec has international customers or international services, they should also follow international privacy principles like GDPR concepts.

## 6. Recommendations
Truelec should follow these ethical recommendations:
- Use clear privacy policy for customers
- Protect systems using strong security controls
- Provide staff security training
- Limit CCTV access only to authorized managers
- Have a clear incident response plan and customer notification process

## 7. Conclusion
In conclusion, Truelec must handle customer and staff data carefully. Ethical behaviour means protecting privacy, preventing misuse, and following laws. Good ethics and strong cyber security will build customer trust and support long-term business success.
