## 4. Project Delivery Risks

- Risk 1: Poor GitHub contribution from one member  
  - Impact: Low professionalism marks and unfair workload  
  - Solution: Weekly commit requirement for both members

- Risk 2: Confusion about IP addressing rules  
  - Impact: Loss of marks in network section  
  - Solution: Follow /16 or /24 rule and avoid private IPs

- Risk 3: Time shortage near deadline  
  - Impact: Rushed writing and incomplete sections  
  - Solution: Weekly milestone completion and early draft writing
