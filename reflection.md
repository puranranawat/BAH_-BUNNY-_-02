# Task 4.5 – Project Reflection

## 1. Overview
This project required our team to design a full network for Truelec and also complete cloud, cyber security, ethics, and reflection tasks. We worked together using GitHub and regular communication. This reflection explains how we contributed and what we learned.

## 2. Evidence of Contribution (Git Commits)
We used GitHub commits to show our work contributions.
- Student 1 total commits: <<STUDENT1_COMMITS>>
- Student 2 total commits: <<STUDENT2_COMMITS>>

## 3. Task Split (Who did what)

### Team Member 1 Contribution
Student 1 completed:
- HQ diagram design and explanation
- WiFi settings and design section
- Hardware list section
- Part of security controls writing

### Team Member 2 Contribution
Student 2 completed:
- Branch diagram and WAN connectivity section
- VLAN and IPv4 addressing plan
- Cloud pricing and cost comparison
- Risk assessment template and TVA matrix screenshots
- Ethics and reflection writing support

## 4. Commit Activity vs Work Completed
The commit history mostly matches the work done by each team member. We committed changes regularly during the working weeks. In some cases, one member committed more because they merged files and fixed formatting. However, both members contributed meaningful work in writing and research.

## 5. What Went Well
The following points went well in our project:
- We communicated regularly and shared progress updates.
- We planned weekly milestones and completed work step by step.
- We used GitHub for version control and avoided major file loss.
- Our network design was clear and structured.

## 6. Challenges Faced
We faced a few challenges:
- Understanding strict IP addressing rules was confusing at first.
- Cloud pricing calculators were complex and required time.
- Risk assessment required detailed thinking about threats and vulnerabilities.
- Formatting and combining content into final reports took time.

## 7. Improvements for Future Projects
In the future, we will improve by:
- Starting cloud research earlier
- Creating a shared checklist based on rubric
- Using GitHub issues for task tracking
- Doing weekly progress review meetings
- Making stronger commit discipline during all weeks

## 8. Conclusion
In conclusion, this project helped us learn practical network design, cloud services comparison, and cyber security risk management. We also improved teamwork skills through planning and GitHub usage. These skills will help us in future IT and cyber security projects.
